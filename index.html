				<h4> What is FGM/C?</h4>
					<p> Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is a harmful traditional practice involving the cutting or removal of the external female genitalia. It has existed for more than 2,000 years and is performed on girls from birth up to just before marriage and sometimes beyond. FGM/C is also known as "female circumcision" and by other terms locally.

								<p> FGM/C is practised across all eight Local Government Areas (LGAs) in The Gambia and by both Christians (20.9% of Christian women aged 15–49) and Muslims (77.3%).
								</p>
								<p>
								The LGA with the highest prevalence is Basse, the eastern-most and most rural region, at 95% of women aged 15–49.  The LGA with the lowest prevalence is Banjul, a coastal area and the most urbanised, at 48.8%.  The Basse region is predominantly inhabited by the Sarahule, Mandinka and Fula ethnic groups, whereas the coastal areas of Banjul and Kanifing are predominantly inhabited by the Wolof (among whom the prevalence of FGM/C has historically been the lowest among The Gambia’s different ethnic groups) and the Mandinka.  Overall, the prevalence of FGM/C among women aged 15–49 who live in urban areas is 77.3%, and among those living in rural areas is 71.7%.
								</p>
								<p> According to the MICS 2018, the overall prevalence among women aged 15–49 is 75.7%.  By comparison, the MICS 2010 found that prevalence among women of the same age-range was 76.3%, suggesting that the extent of the practice has remained broadly similar in recent years.
								</p>
								<p>
								Of women aged 15–49 who have heard of FGM/C, 44% feel that the practice should continue, although among women who have not undergone FGM/C, that figure drops to 6.6%.

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-6 pt-1">
					<p> Female genital mutilation (FGM) refers to “all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.” While the exact number of girls and women worldwide who have undergone FGM remains unknown, at least 200 million girls and women have been cut in 31 countries with representative data on prevalence. FGM is a violation of girls’ and women’s human rights and is condemned many international treaties and conventions, as well as by national legislation in many countries. Yet, where it is practised, FGM is performed in line with tradition and social norms to ensure that girls are socially accepted and marriageable, and to uphold their status and honour and that of the entire family. UNICEF works with government, civil society partners and other UN agencies towards the elimination of FGM in countries where it is still practised.

		<h4 class="text-center"> Gambian Parliament Moves Forward On Bill to Reverse FGM Ban </h4>
			<p> Gambian lawmakers voted to advance to the next parliamentary stage a bill to reverse the ban on female genital mutilation (FGM), sparking concerns among activists about potential harm to the country's human rights progress.<br>
			The ban, in place since 2015, saw a significant decrease in FGM prevalence in Gambia, but proponents of the reversal argue it upholds religious and cultural values. Activists and human rights organizations say the suggested legislation reverses years of progress and risks damaging the country's human rights record.<br>
			A UN report shows a significant drop in female genital mutilation (FGM) in Gambia since it was banned, highlighting the effectiveness of such legislation. The World Health Organization says female circumcision has no health benefits and can lead to excessive bleeding, shock, psychological problems, and death. Gambia faces a critical decision, as repealing the ban would be an unprecedented setback in protecting girls from this harmful practice.

						    <p class="card-text"> A vote by The Gambia’s legislature to uphold a 2015 ban on female genital mutilation (FGM) has been hailed by campaigners as a victory for women and girls in the tiny West African country. However, concerns over the enforcement of the ban have only deepened. Interestingly enough, our research reveals that a good number of members of the Joint Committee were against the bill.</p>

						    <p class="card-text"> When traditional cutters are involved, non-sterile devices are likely to be used, including knives, razors, scissors, glass, sharpened rocks, and fingernails. According to a nurse in Uganda, quoted in 2007 in The Laucet, a cutter would use one knife on up to 30 girls at a time. The rejection of the bill is a relief and a necessary step in continuing to protect and uphold the rights of women and girls in The Gambia</p>

"The President had given assurances that this bill would not go through, but unfortunately he reneged on that." Concerns over the enforcement of the ban have only deepened.</p>
